Things I learned
Semantic UI is great - wasted 0 time on CSS and looks 20 times better than if i actually did spend time on it.


Conditional rendering - was a big breakthrough when i figured out how to wait for my props to populate from API calls before rendering them. Much more visually appealing to render loading icons to let the user know what is happening


Future Improvements:
Form validation & confirmation


Improve the activity feed to select and view other’s watchlist


Delete / edit watchlists 


Date selection for charts
